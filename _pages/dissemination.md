### Publications
Our publications from 2019 onwards can be found on the [CrySP publications page](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/publications). Earlier publications are available on the Aalto [SSG publications page](https://ssg.aalto.fi/publications/).

Sometimes we [blog about our research results](https://crysp.uwaterloo.ca/ssg/blog).
