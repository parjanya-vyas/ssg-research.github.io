# Future Internet Architectures

## Background

The dramatic growth of the Internet has enabled ubiquitous access to information, fostering seamless communication and promoting effective collaboration.  Unfortunately, these capabilities have empowered state-level actors to deploy large-scale surveillance and censorship mechanisms to monitor people's Internet activities or limit their ability to freely access and publish information.  Although Internet surveillance and censorship mechanisms have substantially broadened and become more capable over the past decades, the deployment of effective privacy-enhancing tools remains a significant challenge.
