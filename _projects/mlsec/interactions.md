# Unintended Interactions among ML Risks and Defenses

## Background 

Machine learning models are susceptible to a wide range of risks to security, privacy, and fairness. 
Several defenses have been proposed to mitigate these risks. 
However, defending against a specific risk can result in an unintended increase or decrease in susceptibility to other risks. 
One approach to address these unintended interactions is by combining multiple defenses together. 
However, there could be conflicting interactions among different defenses which need to be accounted by ML practitioners.
